# Part 1. C-style Pointers
As we learned in class, a pointer (\*) is a reference to a memory address. By itself, a pointer cannot help us perform most of the tasks we've grown accustomed to doing, such as storing data. Instead, pointers allow us to pass data around our program in a different manner than we have been doing thus far, allocate memory during the programs execution, and even store pointers to functions into arrays, allowing us to pass some value to multiple functions via a loop. What fun!

The focus of today's lab will be the simplest of pointer usage; to pass a variable's memory address to a function.

If I were to ask you to write a void function that accepts two integers, *a* and *b*, then adds the value of *b* into *a*, you may do the following:

```c++
void add(int a, int b);

int main(){
  int val = 5;
  add(val, 3);
  std::cout << val << std::endl;
}

void add(int a, int b){
  a += b;
}
```
But the issue with this function is that since the add function has two integers as its parameters, every time this function is called it has two new memory locations for *a* and *b*, that hold copied values of whatever was given to them. Visually, it looks something like this.

Then after the addition occurs, we end up with this:

![Document Image 2](./images/ss2.png)

Since these variables are both local to the add() function, they disappear when the function exits and our 8 value is lost. This is exactly the issue that a pointer would fix. Instead of a being a new variable with its own memory address, we want it to point to an existing memory address.

```c++
void addInto(int* a, int b);

int main()
{
	int sum = 5;

	addInto(&sum, 3);
	std::cout << sum << std::endl;
}

void addInto(int* a, int b) {
	(*a) += b;
}
```

There are a few changes to the above code. First, our function accepts an integer pointer *a*, and an integer *b*, as opposed to the two integers it previously had. Second, instead of passing *sum* directly into the function call, we use the '&' to specify we want to pass the **memory address** of *sum*. Third, in our function we specify that we first want to **de-reference** *a* **prior** to performing the addition. Visually, our initial setup is this:

And the result after the addition is this:

:white_check_mark: 1. Create a void function called *square* that accepts an integer pointer and stores the square of that number into the passed address. Print this number in main.

:white_check_mark: 2. Write a void function *countEvens* that accepts an array and an integer pointer. The pointer should be used to count the # of even numbers in the array. Be sure to de-reference properly!

:white_check_mark: 3. What does the following code output? (You can assume it compiles).

```c++
#include <iostream>

int main() {
	int nums[] = {5, 10, 15, 20};
	int *x = &nums[2];
	int *y = x+1;
	std::cout << *x + *y;
}
```

:white_check_mark: 4. What does the following code output? (You can assume it compiles).

```c++
    #include <iostream>

    void foo(int x, int *someP) {
        *someP = x + 1;
        x = 80;
    }

    int main() {
        int a = 30;
        int b = 60;
        int *p = &a;
        int *z = &b;

        *p = 12;
        b = a;
        *p = 21;

        std::cout << "1: a=" << a << ", b=" << b << std::endl;
        foo(a, z);
        std::cout << "2: a=" << a << ", b=" << b << std::endl;

        *p = 1;
        p = z;
        *p = 3;

        std::cout << "3: a=" << a << ", b=" << b << std::endl;

        return 0;
    }

```

# Part 2. Multi-dimensional Arrays

Multi-dimensional arrays allow us to *gasp* store multiple dimensions worth of data!

The normal rules of arrays apply: you cannot determine the size of array outside the scope it is declared in, and you must specify the size of the dimensions. Well, except for the first one.

Lets take a look at the following code. In it, we have two functions: fillArray() and printArray(). Note that I am using a *const int* to determine the size of my array. This makes changing the size of my array dimensions easier. The fillArray() function simply creates 5 rows of {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}, while the printArray() function does what it says its does.

```c++
const int arrSize = 5;

void fillArray(int arr[][arrSize]);
void printArray(int arr[][arrSize]);

int main()
{
	int myArr[arrSize][arrSize];
	
	printArray(myArr);
	fillArray(myArr);
	printArray(myArr);
}

void fillArray(int arr[][arrSize]) {
	for (int i = 0; i < arrSize; i++) {
		for (int j = 0; j < arrSize; j++) {
			arr[i][j] = j;
		}
	}
}

void printArray(int arr[][arrSize]) {
	for (int i = 0; i < arrSize; i++) {
		for (int j = 0; j < arrSize; j++) {
			std::cout << arr[i][j] << " ";
		}
		std::cout << std::endl;
	}
	std::cout << std::endl;
}
```

The printArray() call prior to the fillArray() call prints out a 5x5 array of random values. Why is that?
When you declare an array without initializing it, you end up with an array filled with garbage values. Essentially, whatever was in that location in memory ends up in your array.

Wait a minute. the fillArray() function accepts an array (not a pointer to an array!), and is of type *void*. How are the values leaving the fillArray() function and displaying correctly in printArray()!?

As covered in lecture, the short answer; arrays are themselves references. This holds true for multi-dimensional arrays as well, regardless of the number of dimensions!

:white_check_mark: 5. Re-write the fillArray() function in the example above to store a multiplication table (without the headers) into *arr*. e.g. for *arrSize = 3* the array should be filled as:<br>
1 2 3<br>
2 4 6<br>
3 6 9<br>

:white_check_mark: 6. Write a program that will store 3 exam grades for 4 students as amultidimensional array, and a function to calculate the average for each student, and another function to calculate the average for each exam. 

# Part 3. Dynamic Memory (New / Delete)

Dynamic memory is memory stored on what is known as the **heap**. This is where values that are unknown at compile time, hence not valid for the stack, are going to have to be stored. This allows for us to store things like variable length arrays in a program and operate on them accordingly.

## 3.1 Operators new and new[]

Dynamic memory is allocated using operator `new`. `new` is followed by a data type specifier and, if a sequence of more than one element is required, the number of these within brackets []. It returns a pointer to the beginning of the new block of memory allocated. Its syntax is:

`pointer = new type` <br>
`pointer = new type [number_of_elements]`


The first expression is used to allocate memory to contain one single element of type type. The second one is used to allocate a block (an array) of elements of type type, where number_of_elements is an integer value representing the amount of these. For example, consider the code below:

```c++
int * foo;
foo = new int [5];

```

In this case, the system dynamically allocates space for five elements of type int and returns a pointer to the first element of the sequence, which is assigned to foo (a pointer). Therefore, foo now points to a valid block of memory with space for five elements of type int.

![Document Image 3](./images/dynamic.png)

Here, foo is a pointer, and thus, the first element pointed to by foo can be accessed either with the expression foo[0] or the expression *foo (both are equivalent). The second element can be accessed either with foo[1] or *(foo+1), and so on...

There is a substantial difference between declaring a normal array and allocating dynamic memory for a block of memory using new. The most important difference is that the size of a regular array needs to be a constant expression, and thus its size has to be determined at the moment of designing the program, before it is run, whereas the dynamic memory allocation performed by new allows to assign memory during runtime using any variable value as size.

The dynamic memory requested by our program is allocated by the system from the memory heap. However, computer memory is a limited resource, and it can be exhausted. Therefore, there are no guarantees that all requests to allocate memory using operator new are going to be granted by the system. We can see this behavior in memory for the exact block of code you just saw using the `new` command.

![Document Image 4](./images/ss5.png)

Notice that this array was allocated on the `heap` because of the `new` command.

C++ provides two standard mechanisms to check if the allocation was successful:

One is by handling exceptions. Using this method, an exception of type bad_alloc is thrown when the allocation fails. Exceptions are a powerful C++ feature explained later in these tutorials. But for now, you should know that if this exception is thrown and it is not handled by a specific handler, the program execution is terminated.

This exception method is the method used by default by new, and is the one used in a declaration like:

```c++
foo = new int [5];  // if allocation fails, an exception is thrown

```

This method can be specified by using a special object called nothrow, declared in header `<new>`, as argument for new:

```c++
foo = new (nothrow) int [5]; 
```

In this case, if the allocation of this block of memory fails, the failure can be detected by checking if foo is a null pointer:
```c++
int * foo;
foo = new (nothrow) int [5];
if (foo == nullptr) {
  // error assigning memory. Take measures.
}
```

This nothrow method is likely to produce less efficient code than exceptions, since it implies explicitly checking the pointer value returned after each and every allocation. Therefore, the exception mechanism is generally preferred, at least for critical allocations. Still, most of the coming examples will use the nothrow mechanism due to its simplicity.

## 3.2 Operators delete and delete[]

In most cases, memory allocated dynamically is only needed during specific periods of time within a program; once it is no longer needed, it can be freed so that the memory becomes available again for other requests of dynamic memory. This is the purpose of operator delete, whose syntax is:

`delete pointer;` <br>
`delete[] pointer;`<br>

The first statement releases the memory of a single element allocated using new, and the second one releases the memory allocated for arrays of elements using new and a size in brackets ([]).

The value passed as argument to delete shall be either a pointer to a memory block previously allocated with new, or a null pointer (in the case of a null pointer, delete produces no effect).

As a **warning**, in C/C++ all memory that is dynamically allocated **must** be manually freed (`delete`'d). The language **will not** do this for you. If you don't free memory before a program finishes it is possible that memory will stay reserved. With no way to free that memory now (as our pointer has been destroyed) we could possibly eventually fill all of our memory and cause our machine to crash. This is extremely unlikely in the scope of this course as nothing we are working on will actually trigger this case, but it should still be mentioned. As long we are working with single dimensional arrays on the heap, this case will be handled by normal execution, but should not be relied on. As soon as you have multi dimensiona arrays on the heap, this memory issue can occur and is a **disasterous** error in your code, this is known as a **memory leak** as we have leaked away some of our systems memory with no way to recover it outside of a full system restart. 

:white_check_mark: 7. Consider the below code and describe what the `delete[]` command is doing. What would happen if we only used `delete`?

```c++

int * foo = new int[5];

for(int i = 0 ; i < 5 ; i++) {
  foo[i] = i;
}

for(int i = 0 ; i < 5 ; i++) {
  std::cout << foo[i];
}

std::cout << std::endl;

delete[] foo;
```

:white_check_mark: 8. Write a program that accepts a number of data points *n*, stores them into an array, and uses a pointer *max* that will point to the largest value. 

:white_check_mark: 9. Create a void function called *findStats* that will calculate the mean, median, and mode of an array of ints of size *n*. Store these values in an array and return this array from the function (note: there is a reason this question is in the dynamic memory section).
