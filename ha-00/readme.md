# Assignment 0: Milestones in the History of Computing (due 9/20/19)

In this assignment you are expected to work in groups.   Your group will write a short paper titled: `Milestones in the History of Computing`.  To this end, follow the steps below:

1. Form a group of 4-5 students

2. Your paper should include a list of sections (milestones) in the history of computing.  Under each section you are expected to provide a brief narrative related to that particular milestone.  Below, we have listed the required milestones as a way for you to organize the paper, as well as to help divide up the work between group members.  We aren't looking for large sections, just a few paragraphs for each is fine.  A good way to summarize each section is:

    - Describe events related to the section
    - Include the years when the events happened
    - What is the significance of these events in a wider context?

3. Divide up the following sections (milestones) evenly between group members:

    - Charles Babbage's and Ada Lovelace contributions
    - Herman Hollerith's punch card system
    - The Turing Machine
    - Electronic Numerical Integrator and Calculator (ENIAC), the first general-purpose electronic computer
    - Von Neumann's Architecture
    - UNIVAC, the first commercial computer for business and government applications
    - Invention of the Transistor
    - Grace Hopper and the first computer language
    - Invention of Integrated Circuits
    - ARPANET
    - UNIX operating system
    - The C Language
    - Altair 8800, first commercially successful personal computer
    - 'C with Classes' and C++
    - References (A list of articles, webpages, books, or other documents that were consulted when working on the assignment)

4. Once you have each finished your own sections, you should now consolidate the individual sections and make one paper for the entire group to submit.

5. Perform a peer review among your group members, making sure everyone proofreads the document. Not only should the quality of each section be checked, but the quality of the paper as a whole. Make any necessary changes to the document as a group.

6. It is pertinent at this point to make clear that this is a group assignment in every sense, and as such you will all be scored together.  You should verify that everyone's contributions are not plagiarized from the internet.  If your document contains substantial portions of plagiarized text, _all_ members will be penalized.

7. Your paper can contain figures, tables, images etc. The length including these media should be about 7-12 pages.

8. To submit the assignment, you should generate a PDF containing each group members' name and upload it to Gradescope by the due date (9/20).
